The mayor, Colan Sylvester, and some members of the Mayoral Committee visited the fleet management unit to receive the vehicles on Thursday, 8 December. Receipt of these vehicles can only be good news for the community of the Greater Oudtshoorn since vehicles or transport is an essential tool of service delivery in a municipality, Sylvester said on receipt of the vehicles. We are currently bolstering our fleet management controls to prevent misuse of state vehicles by officials. We urge the public to help us manage these vehicles by reporting any misuse to the municipality. The municipality entered into a lease agreement of 40 vehicles for three years to replace 54 vehicles that the municipality had previously leased from Avis. According to a press release from the municipality the correct tender processes for the vehicles had been followed. The acquisition of the vehicles is a planned service within the current budget of the municipality. R4,5 million was allocated in the budget for the lease of vehicles to assist in service delivery.&nbsp;
